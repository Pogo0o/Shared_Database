Making all executable programs:
- make

Subprocedures for individual executables:
- make main
- make test
- make standalone

Making the shared object:
- make so

In order to run these programs a library's directory had to be added to cached or otherwise a following problem could occur:
"error while loading shared libraries: libdatabase.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
In oder to resolve above issue use: sudo ldconfig {lib directory}

Testing:
- ./bin/Consumer displays the currnent values for the entire local copy of the database.
- ./bin/Producer increases a record whose index is passed to the program at runtime.

Known issues:
- A deadlock when Consumer tries to Write to a remote database at the same moment when a producer.
- There is no way to determine whether or not shared memory segment was initialized without initializing the mutex and condition variable
  This makes the synchronization mechanism fail, it is fixed by restarting the machine.
