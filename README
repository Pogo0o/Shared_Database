In order to make all the executables:
- make

Subprocedures for individual executables:
- make main
- make test

Making the shared object only:
- make so

Testing:
- ./bin/Consumer displays the currnent values for the entire local copy of the database.
- ./bin/Producer increases a record whose index is passed to the program at runtime.
Programs runs flawlessly directly after a machine boot up, although is not bug-free.

Known bugs:
- Deadlock seems to occur during write operation by the Producer program.
  After problem analysis and debugging it seems that the lock could be connected with operation of Database_Synchronization_Lock and Database_Changed_Signal in shared memory.
- Without properly conducted initialization of shared memory and pthread synchronization tools, the program is no longer allowed to operate optimally.
  This issue is especially visible after a deadlock.
- If shared memory is initialized prior to first launch, the program does not respond.
