Making all executable programs:
- make

Subprocedures for individual executables:
- make main
- make test

Making the shared object:
- make so

In order for the shared library to work it needs to be cached, to do so one can use ldconfig with ./lib/ parameter.
I have done it this way as I have assumed this library should be put in a folder with all dynamic libraries that is already added as a library search path.
After consideration I have decided not to put it in a directory with all linux libraries, as it required access to super user privilages.

Testing:
- ./bin/Consumer displays the currnent values for the entire local copy of the database.
- ./bin/Producer increases a record whose index is passed to the program at runtime.

Known issues:
- Deadlock seems to occur during write operation by the Producer program.
- Without properly conducted initialization of shared memory and pthread synchronization tools, the program is no longer allowed to operate.
  This issue is especially visible after a deadlock.
