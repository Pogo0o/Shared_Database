Making all executable programs:
- make

Subprocedures for individual executables:
- make main
- make test

Making the shared object:
- make so

Testing:
- ./bin/Consumer displays the currnent values for the entire local copy of the database.
- ./bin/Producer increases a record whose index is passed to the program at runtime.

Known issues:
- A deadlock when Consumer tries to Write to a remote database at the same moment when a producer.
- There is no way to determine whether or not shared memory segment was initialized without initializing the mutex and condition variable
  This makes the synchronization mechanism fail, it is fixed by restarting the machine.
